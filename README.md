### **This is a work done in our CS550 course. We took the model from <code><a href="https://github.com/PeterWang512/CNNDetection">this github link</a></code> for learning. We retrained it with a different dataset (more details can be found inside CNN Detection folder's <code>README</code> file and our <code>project report</code> pdf.)**

<hr/>

### **<code style="text-decoration:underline;color:green">Our Work</code> : Original model was trained on progan dataset with a resnet50 classifier and we trained our model with stylegan dataset (relatively very small dataset, obtained from original model's testing dataset) with resnet101 and resnet152 classifiers. Results and trained models are provided for your reference, links can be found inside main code folder's <code>README</code> file.**
